## CodeBook for tidy dataset

## Row Space

There are a total of 180 rows. Each row corresponds to a unique combination of "SubjectID" and "Activity". Each value is the mean of each measurement for each subject and each activity.

## Column Space

There are a total of 68 columns in the final uploaded tidy dataset:

First 2 columns (1~2):

SubjectID: ID of each subject
Activity: type of activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
Next 40 columns (3~42) are for time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag):

Last 26 columns (43~68) store signals produced after a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. Prefix 'f' indicates frequency domain signals.
